## About

The Sorting Algorithm Visualizer is a Python-based project that provides an interactive visualization of various sorting algorithms. This tool aims to help users understand the inner workings of sorting algorithms by visualizing their step-by-step processes in real-time.


## Features

- Interactive visualization of popular sorting algorithms, including Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and more.
- Customizable array size and sorting speed settings to control the visualization experience.
- Real-time updates and step-by-step visualization of the sorting process.
- User-friendly interface with intuitive controls for easy navigation and interaction.

## Getting Started
